<h2>Introduction</h2>

<section>
<div class="div-heading">
<p>
The Triennial involves the efforts of 120 artists, including Australians as well as artists from around the globe. These artists specialise in many fields, such as painting, sculpture, film, animation, photography, performance and fashion design. The exhibition is held every three years, and it aims to provide a “powerful and moving portrait of the world today” – through the collection and placement of the art installations, it intends to inspire the audience to consider the state of the modern world, their place in it, and question their own preconceived notions on a myriad of topics relevant to the world today – such as the impact of history on the present, the hidden costs of every day products on human workers and animals (see Fernando Laposse, Basse Stittgen), and the rapidly developing technologies such as AI and its implications on art and the social climate (Kevin Abosch). Each artist provides their own voice, their experiences and knowledge contributing to this “portrait of the world”.
This exhibition will be open from the 3rd of December 2023 to the 7th of April 2024, every day from 10am to 5pm. More information can be found on their <a href="https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/triennial/home/" target="_blank">official website</a>.

</figure>

<div>
<p>
The Italian artist <b>Maurizio Cattelan</b> shocked the art world in 2019 with “Comedian” – which is a banana duct-taped to a wall. It is very reminiscent of Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 sculpture (he described it as such) “Fountain”, a urinal which he bought and signed his name on. This and “Comedian” force us to reconsider what counts as art – can anything be art, and if not, what are the “rules” for what we consider art to be? Another similarity between the two works come from how gallery-goers have reacted to them. Both “Comedian” and “Fountain” have been “used” for their “original purposes” – in 1990, famous musician Brian Eno attempted to urinate in “Fountain” (this was far from the last attempt). Similarly, Cattelan’s “Comedian” has been eaten a few times. David Datuna, a performance artist, ate the banana in 2019, thus creating his own artwork from Cattelan’s – “Hungry Artist”, because “[he] was hungry and [he] just ate it.” He did not do this as an act of vandalism or rebellion, rather, he thought it was “cool” to eat “the concept of the artist”. He praised Cattelan as one of the top artists of the world. Later in 2023, the banana was eaten for the second time. When asked why, South Korean art student Noh Huyn-soo stated he was “hungry”, a similar reason to Datuna’s. He further explained, “Damaging an artwork could also be seen as an artwork, I thought that would be interesting… Isn’t it taped there to be eaten?” The banana was replaced, and there were no repercussions for the student. Cattelan himself said he had no issue with this whatsoever. Noh’s reasoning is less known, and his action could be interpretted in two ways – similar to Datuna’s, as acting inside the context of this being “art”, or instead as rebelling against the idea by purposefully acting in a way which highlights its absurdity.

</figure>

<p>
From this comparison with “Fountain” comes a common criticism of the work. Modern art often needs to be innovative and new. One might argue that “Comedian” has basically been done before, that it is simply a rehash of “Fountain”. On the curation of the work – not much needs to be done. It doesn’t need to be enclosed in a glass box, nor does there need to be a sign saying “do not eat the banana” because it doesn’t matter if it’s eaten, at least, Cattelan has no issue with it. The attitude that modern art is pointless, made without effort and even “degenerate” is a common sentiment – “Comedian” is a further example of how decisive contemporary expressions of creativity can be.

<p>
<b>Iluwanti Ken</b>, a Pitjantjatjara artist, was born in 1944. The Triennial had her work “Walawuru ngunytju kukaku ananyi (Mother eagles going hunting)” on display. Created in 2023, the artist used ink and synthetic polymer paint on 210.5 by 509.0 cm canvas to create this artwork. She uses her art as a visual form of storytelling, painting the “stories of [her] father’s country”. Her use of negative and positive space provides a brilliant contrast, making her work eye-catching and vivid despite the lack of colour. In person, the largeness of the artwork creates the impression of grandness and permanence – “past, present and future”. Each panel makes use of a large mass of black, drawing the eye down vertically from the first to the last panel. Details of the landscape – fauna and flora, are painted with precision in the mass. The mother eagle is depicted as soaring above this landscape.

<p>
<b>Nic Brunsdon</b>, architect, was born in 1980. His project “(This is) Air” was displayed at the Triennial. Created in 2023 in collaboration with the ENESS (self-described as “work that speaks to the heart of what it means to be human”), the instillation is a large white sphere that reaches a peak of 14 meters high when fully inflated. The primary material of the work is a unique choice – air. Situated in the NGV garden, the work is intended to put humans face to face with an ever-present element that goes unacknowledged despite its great importance. This work can be analysed through many different lenses – for example, when considering climate change, it servse as a reminder of the importance of clean, unpolluted air, something that becomes more scarce day by day as a result of pollution from human activities. The work can also represent human breath, and the risk that comes with interacting with others – from inescapable discrimination and othering, the challenges of human intimacy as well as in reference to the pandemic – the physical threat of Covid-19.

</figure>

<div>
<p>
Duo <b>Elmgreen & Dragset</b> is composed of German artists <b>Michael Elmgreen</b> and <b>Ingar Dragset</b>. Showcased in a large, mostly empty room with white walls and a light grey ground is their collection of works, composed of sculptures and installations. “Powerless structures” is a set of black levis and calvin klein underwear, layed on the floor in a heap in the corner. Audiences are encouraged to look but not touch; the white text on the floor reads “Please do not touch”. The clothing being thrown to the corner might represent carelessness or marginalisation. It also implies nakedness, of the people who those clothes belong to, which itself may imply sexual intimacy. A common theme in Elmgreen & Dragset’s work is sexuality, and the perception of the body. The works “What’s left” and “The painter” speaks to the concept of “useless bodies” – when so much of our activities are online, what is made of our physical, three-dimensional bodies that exist in the real world?

</figure>

<p>
Divorced from the original context, the sculptures’ meanings are harder to dissern. “What’s left” is a colored sculpture of a human holding a long pole, suspended from the ceiling. The curator of this exhibition space would have had to ensure that the beam it hangs from is strong enough to hold its weight. The sculpture being suspended in the air is key to the piece, as it forces the audience to look upwards to see it – this contrasts against “powerless structures”, which force the audience to look down.

</figure>

<div>
<p>
<b>Daniel Roseberry</b>’s <b>Schiaparelli</b> collection showcases the immense power that curation has on how an artwork is interpreted and felt by audiences. The clothes are put on display on a tilted, disk like surface – having the artwork placed on a separate platform protects the artwork by discouraging the audience from touching it, as it is seen as a “stage” – it is also a nod to the surrealist elements present in most of Schiaparelli and the collection on display. The room’s walls are digital screens of a midnight sky dotted with stars, allowing the audience to be fully encompassed in an ethereal, other-worldly experience. The pieces themselves are meticulously designed – universal in its appeal as beautiful and feminine clothing but not boring in the slightest. The clothing on display follows a consistent theme of  gold, pink and white, enchanting reflective surfaces and flowy fabric. Each piece is crafted with immense detail, showcasing the care put into the collection. Schiaparelli’s influence from the art movement of surrealism, a reaction to world war one, reflects the way in which art can not only be used to speak directly on the conditions on this hectic world as many works in the Triennial do, but can also act as an alternate reality – an escape that brings out the mystical, the magical, and the grand.

<p>
The white dress, from Roseberry’s first collection which explored themes of displacement, was an outlier from said collection – one of the two dresses that utilized the flowy, cloud like “structure” to evoke the emotions of dreams. The “shocking pink” (coined by Elsa Schiaparelli) dress from the spring-summer 2021 collection combines elements of surrealism in the way that the dress is held up through the hoops of the earrings, and with feminine elegance in the way that the dress flows and drapes. Besides the dresses and jackets on display, a cabinet holds a few items – a common theme being the infusing of human body parts (faces, lungs) onto objects (necklaces, bags).

<p>
<b>Richard Lewer</b> was born in New Zealand, 1970, but has lived in Australia since 1997. Created in 2022, his artwork is a collection of 12 paintings, each made with synthetic polymer paint on 152.6 by 152.7 cm canvas. Each work is titled as the passage from the bible that it depicts. A wide variety of muted colours are utilised depending on the painting. In “A river watering the garden flowed from the garden of Eden and from there separated into four waterways.”, deep purples and blues are used in tangent with a bold grey, creating an impression of a vast galaxy. These dark colours help to bring out the small spots of light, such as the speckle-like stars, the round moon and river. The painting of the birth of Eve from Adam (“God said ‘It is not good for man to be alone, I will make a helper suitable for him’. God put Adam into a deep sleep and while he slept he took a rib from the man’s chest and closed up the wound with flesh. God made a woman from Adam’s rib. He named her Eve.”) depicts the two with bleeding edges and patches of grey, which is reminiscent of the moon, implying a cosmic permanence to these figures. Eve in particular is blood and bones; providing a strong contrast between the mortal flesh of humanity and the transcendent bodies of nature and God. The darkness of the room that the artwork is displayed in allows the ghostly figures of Adam and Eve to shine.

</figure>

<div>
<p>
The medium of video is utilised in <b>Nadiah Bamadhaj</b>’s work, “Tepersona dengan Kegelisahan (Charmed by anxiety)”.  The work itself is a video of Indonesian soldiers performing a dance, video and sound both edited in slow-motion. It takes the feelings of awe, strength and power from the original dance and transforms it into a contemplatory experience of dread. In order for the work to have its full effect, the audience must be completely fixated on the art, hence why the viewer is placed in a dark, closed room and seated in the middle to face the large screen square on. Like many other works of modern art, it does not provide a concrete thesis of its own – instead, it forces the audience to consider the various interpretations on the themes it presents. A subversion of the traditional concepts of power and hierarchies in society, the work is powerfully effective in creating an enclosed atmosphere where audiences can consider its message and themes.

</figure>

<p>
<b>Todd Gray</b>’s work “the hidden order of the whole (Venus)” can be found in the red- painted salon-style room. At first glance, it may easily be overlooked as one of the many classical paintings on the wall – however, its thin frame and subject matter make it quickly discernable as a different work. A series of four photographs that overlap each other (a technique Gray often uses in his work), it juxtaposes “signifiers of the West [and] colonisation” with “signifiers of the African diaspora”. Its placement in this room is perfect for the nature of the work and the conversation that it wants to start, being a reminder of the connections between European aesthetics and ideals, and the way it is interconnected with African diaspora and history.

</figure>

<p>
Germany’s <b>Basse Stittgen</b> is known for his work involving blood. The work displayed in the NGV is his “Blood record”, a record which is made of cow blood, which plays a cow’s heartbeat. Situated in a dark, small corner, it is intended to connect the audience to the “realities of industrial abattoir production”. Audiences interact with the work both visually and aurally, and the smallness and darkness of the room it is in helps facilitate close concentration on the artwork. However, this placement may cause the project to be literally overlooked – it would be very easy for a museum-goer to look past it. </p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Other projects in this line of work (“Blood related”) by Stittgen are his series of tableware, also made of blood. He describes this in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/basse_stittgen_why_i_use_blood_as_a_material" target="_blank">talk</a>  where he says: “it relates to the consumption and the over-consumption of the animal,” “it puts on the table what usually […] remains unseen”. The same idea is behind the “Blood record”. Besides animal blood, Stittgen has also used the blood of HIV positive people in his work – he was adverse to using his own blood because he thought it was “narcissistic”, when that blood could be donated. By using the blood of HIV positive people – people who are not able to donate their blood – he intends to confront the stigma and fear around the disease, which, as he describes – transforms into a fear of the individual.
</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://magazine.tedxvienna.at/2021/12/19/the-invisible-an-interview-with-basse-stittgen-at-tedxvienna-untold/" target="_blank">Ted</a> he discusses how the project has changed him in many ways; he became vegetarian, and also started to confront his own fear and stigma of blood and HIV, letting himself “see the person” instead of just seeing the disease. His contention is summed up: “I’m not saying we should stop eating meat but just be aware of it.” Through “Blood record” and his other artifacts made of blood, he wants to make the audience more aware of the undergoings of every day life.

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<div class="div-heading">
<p>
The NGV Triennial’s theme of magic, memory and matter were explored through the artworks on display. The diversity of artform, material, technique and culture added to a  body of work not homogenous in the slightest, although all bound together by central themes. All three themes are very wide, so that they could be applied to any work in the gallery, although most works are much more specific in the way that it relates to the theme.
</p>

<p>
As all work is composed of “matter” – whether that be paint, photographic print paper or a CRT screen – this theme could be applied to all works in the gallery. However, one may point out that the theme specifically calls for work that explore the relationship that matter constructs, such as the one between nature and humanity, or humanity with technology. The theme of “memory” can also be applied to all artworks because every work is necessarily created through memory, and also creates memory itself. However, which touch on this theme specifically deal with memory’s effects on life – for example, the effect that forgetting or disregarding history has on the lives lived by current people, otherwise, the work may simply be a reminder of important historical and cultural artefacts that are vital to remember. “Magic” is not only to do with literal mysticism, but any kind of human belief system which relates to religion and spirituality. 
</p>
 
<p>
The vast number of pieces that are exhibited means that the exhibition can be overwhelming to take in, and that even an incredibly thorough visit may result in a few works being missed. The exhibition is set out so that there are multiple paths one can take to reach the same rooms, which can be confusing to navigate – however, not much can be done about this without sacrificing the number of artworks that need to be displayed, or changing the floorplan altogether. In total, the pieces are placed strategically in the best way possible to ensure a comprehensive experience for the audience.
</p>

<p>
The Triennial doesn’t attempt to give any answers or reach a solid thesis on the questions it posits – this would be impossible, as the viewpoints of the artists and their artworks are widely varied, and this varietey is a key facet of the gallery. The works on display at the Triennial certainly aren’t for everybody. Many will think, as I heard one visitor say, that “nothing here looks good!” – which is a fair sentiment to have. Many works in the collection may seem bizzare, pointless, vapid and without any aesthetic merit. Especially when it comes to works like “Comedian”, which don’t require any artistic skill to create. It is true that a toddler could have made it. However, one must distinguish between the value of the artwork with its aesthetic value and craftsmanship, because an artwork’s purpose may not be in how skilled the artist is, or how beautiful and awe-inspiring it looks – it may be in its message, and the emotions or ideas it wants to communicate.
</p>

<p>
A few fans of contemporary art turn the accusations around, saying that it is actually the paintings of beautiful people and nature that are vapid and pointless, because often they lack meaning or a “deeper message”. However, this gallery acknowledges the fact that both can co-exist, through the way in which contemporary and classical art is placed together. Both have their place and purposes, and in fact, many works are aesthetically pleasing and require immense craftsmanship to make, while also exploring a deeper meaning that requires context to appreciate.
</p>

<p>
In summary, I would strongly recommend the exhibition to anyone who will come with an open-minded attitude and a willingness to delve deeper into the history and context surrounding art, both as a whole, and with individual pieces. For those who are just here for the beauty of the art, there are plenty of beautiful, awe-striking works here too (although this can be quite subjective). I would recommend having a map ready (one can be found on their website) if you want to see everything the gallery has to offer, although, it is also fine to just walk around and see what you come across.
